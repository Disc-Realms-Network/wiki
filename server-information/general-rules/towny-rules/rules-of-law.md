# Rules of Towny

## § 1 - Follow Town & Nation Laws

**§ 1 A**

All players must follow the laws of the town or nation they are in, as long as those laws are reasonable and meet server standards.

**§ 1 B**

Breaking these laws may result in punishment by the town or national leadership. Arrests or punishments must still follow the server’s rules.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you believe your punishment was unfair, you may appeal by opening a support ticket.\
If your appeal is denied and you still refuse to comply, staff may step in to enforce the punishment.
{% endhint %}

## § 2 - Enforcement of Laws

**§ 2 A**

Towns and nations may only enforce laws if those laws are accessible in-game. Laws cannot exist only on Discord or external platforms. Examples of acceptable posting methods:

* A lectern with a written book.
* Laws are posted on signs in a public area.
* Map art that writes the rules onto an item frame.

**§ 2 B**

Residents must be informed of the laws when they join, and of any future law changes. This can be done through a book, a lectern, or another in-game method.

**§ 2 C**

Laws must be reasonable and easy to follow. Laws that are harsh, unclear, or unreasonable may be ignored and overturned by staff.

**§ 2 D**

Punishments must be fair and proportional to the offense. The default punishment is usually a fine (money or items), though alternative punishments may be approved.\
If a punishment is deemed excessive, staff may reduce or replace it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Punishments can be handed out if an abuse of jail powers is found.
{% endhint %}

***

## § 3 - Rights of Residents

**§ 3 A**

Residents always have the right to appeal punishments if they believe a law or its enforcement violates server rules.

**§ 3 B**

If a staff member is from the same town/nation as the accused and is directly involved, they cannot participate in the appeal process to avoid bias.

**§ 3 C**

Breaking a server rule is handled by staff, not by towns. Town authorities must issue tickets for rule violations instead of punishing residents directly.

## § 4 - Outsiders

**§ 4 A**

Towns may also enforce laws against outsiders (non-residents) if the laws are fair and clearly posted, following the same standards as for residents.

**§ 4 B**

Recognized punishments for outsiders include:

* Being marked as an outlaw
* Being embargoed
* Being permanently banned from becoming a resident

{% hint style="danger" %}
As an outlaw, being killed in the town where you are outlawed will lead to a 2-hour jail time. You cannot be attacked within the town you are outlawed in upon becoming an outlaw.
{% endhint %}

**§ 4 C**

It is recommended that outsiders receive a warning first, as it can be that the outsider may not know the laws. Outlawing should be only used for repeat offenses or serious situations.

***

### § 5 - Nations

**§ 5 A**

If a nation wants to enforce nationwide laws, those laws must be listed in every town within the nation.

**§ 5 B**

If each town under a nation has different laws, residents of one town count as outsiders in another unless the entire nation has a unified law code.
