# Towny Rules

## § 1 - Raiding & Griefing

#### § 1A

Players are not allowed to raid or grief builds\* in and outside towns. This includes destroying the environment, stealing from chests, and breaking or ruining buildings.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*Abandoned towns older than 10 days of their deletion, if they are in a ruined state, are allowed to be griefed for rebuilding purposes with permission from an <mark style="color:red;">Admin</mark> or <mark style="color:purple;">Owner</mark>.
{% endhint %}

#### § 1B

You are not allowed to grief public buildings or services such as railways, bridges, and dams. Services can be torn down in states of war when needed; however, this does not permit removing the whole service, only the section that affects your travel in war.

## § 2 - Usage of Hacked Clients and Unfair Advantages.

#### § 2A

Players are not allowed to use Hacked Clients or use unfair advantages to a certain extent, as Disc Realms Towny may allow a select few features that are free to use — these include:

* Freecam (Modrinth Edition) - Can only be used for building purposes.
* No Fog - Removes Fog
* FullBright

Disc Realms does punish players in Towny if they have a hacked client open, even if no hacks are enabled, you will still be punished.

#### § 2B

Using software to create macros or automate tasks from your player is not allowed. Using physical objects or tools to automate tasks is also not allowed and considered a macro.

#### § 2C

You may not replicate existing exploits to give yourself an advantage; this includes dupes, server glitches, server command exploits, etc.

#### § 2D

Duping is considered an unfair advantage; any action done to dupe will be seriously punished.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Punishments range from 1 to 5 days up to a permanent ban.
{% endhint %}

#### § 2E

You may not boost your account in any way, which includes using alternative accounts that you have controlled or owned to receive benefits such as the starter money, extra money from voting, bypassing daily limits, afking in specific areas such as farms/teleportation spots, and joining towns for extra townblocks.

## § 3 - Usage of Machines

Disc Realms Towny allows players to build redstone machines; however, there are limitations on what can be built.

#### § 3A

In cases where a machine can generate lag to a significant extent, you will be advised to operate the machine only during dead hours (<10 players). Ignoring this can lead to the machine being removed from the server.

#### § 3B

In cases where many chests will be needed, you should use barrels instead, where possible, to minimize lag.
