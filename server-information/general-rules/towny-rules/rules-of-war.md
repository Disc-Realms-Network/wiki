# Rules of War

## § 1 - Waging War

**§ 1 A**

It is important to determine if you can wage war on a nation or town. Wars against either without a Casus belli (Reason of War) can be declared if both sides are set to a non-neutral status (Can be checked using /t \<town> or /n \<nation>), if they are missing a "peaceful" or "neutral" status, you can freely declare war without a Casus belli.

**§ 1 B**

If a town or nation has a neutral status enabled, you can open a [support ticket](https://discord.gg/TynreNbA2m) in our Discord server to see if you are eligible to wage war against that town or nation (Casus belli is required in this case).&#x20;

**§ 1 C**

Below is a list of valid reasons (Casus belli) that can be used to disable a town or nation's neutral status if you wish to wage war against them:

* Griefed structure within your nation or outside it - This can be handled through server punishment, but if you wish, you can wage war instead, only if a higher up of the town or nation was the griefer.
* Reclaim lost land in a previous war - Can be done via riots/civil war by townspeople of the lost town or nation\*
* Broken deals or treaties - You can wage war against an offending town or nation if they break any major deals or treaties

## § 2 - Battleground Rules

**§ 2 A**

Usage of these banned items or war methods is considered a war crime and can be punishable by the town/nation with a server-enforced fine or punishment.

These War Crimes include:

* Usage of End Crystals and Respawn Anchors.
* Abuse of the jail feature to trap opposing sides in jail longer than the set jail time for capturing enemies.
* Use of exploits in plugins to give your town or nation an advantage in a fight. (Also punishable by server)
* Invading before the set battle session times (eg&#x20;
