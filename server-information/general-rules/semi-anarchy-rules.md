# Semi-Anarchy Rules

## § 1 - Raiding & Griefing&#x20;

#### § 1A

Players are fully permitted to grief to their heart's content; however, they are not permitted to grief areas that should not be able to be damaged or select events\*.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*Castle Defense allows griefing, for example.
{% endhint %}

## § 2 - Usage of Hacked Clients&#x20;

#### § 2A

Players are not allowed to use Hacked Clients to a certain extent, as Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy may allow a select few features that are free to use — these include:

* Freecam (Modrinth Edition) - Can only be used for building purposes.
* Baritone - Can only be used for Highway building.
* No Fog - Removes Fog
* FullBright

Disc Realms does not punish in Semi-Anarchy if you have a hacked client open; however, if you are caught with cheats enabled that we did not allow, you will be punished.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Punishments range from 1 to 5 days up to a permanent ban.
{% endhint %}
