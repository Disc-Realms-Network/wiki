# Semi-Anarchy Rules

## § 1 - Raiding & Griefing&#x20;

#### § 1A

Players are fully permitted to grief to their heart's content; however, they are not permitted to grief areas that should not be damaged or select events\*.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*Castle Defense allows griefing, for example.
{% endhint %}

## § 2 - Usage of Hacked Clients and Unfair Advantages.

#### § 2A

Players are not allowed to use Hacked Clients or use unfair advantages to a certain extent, as Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy may allow a select few features that are free to use — these include:

* Freecam (Modrinth Edition) - Can only be used for building purposes.
* Baritone - Can only be used for Highway building.
* No Fog - Removes Fog
* FullBright

Disc Realms does not punish players in Semi-Anarchy if they have a hacked client open; however, if they are caught with cheats enabled that we have not allowed, they will be punished.

#### § 2B

Using software to create macros or automate tasks from your player is not allowed. Using physical objects or tools to automate tasks is also not allowed and considered a macro.

#### § 2C

You may not replicate existing exploits to give yourself an advantage; this includes dupes, server glitches,  server command exploits, etc.

#### § 2D

Duping is considered an unfair advantage; any action done to dupe will be seriously punished.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Punishments range from 1 to 5 days up to a permanent ban.
{% endhint %}

## § 3 - Usage of Machines

Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy allows players to build redstone machines; however, there are limitations on what can be created.

#### § 3A

In cases where a machine can generate lag to a significant extent, you will be advised to operate the machine only during dead hours (<10 players). Ignoring this can lead to the machine being removed from the server.

## § 4 - In-Game Rank Sales

#### § 4A

Players are allowed to trade with each other to obtain in-game ranks through trade. Below are ways you can initiate such a trade:

* You may offer in-game items or cash for a Disc Realms Rank/Store Product and vice versa.

Not Allowed:

* Selling in-game items or cash in return for real-life money, items, or in-game items/cash/ranks of other servers or games.

#### § 4B

Scamming in trades of this type is protected. If an incident happens, please create a ticket, and we will resolve it based on the provided proof. However, we do not insure items, ranks, or cash for illegal trades within the server.&#x20;

## § 5 - Misleading New Players

#### § 5A

You must not mislead new players in Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy. If you do, you will face the same punishments as the new player affected by your misleading information.

## § 6 - Chat

#### § 6A

You are not to spam or bypass chat filters in place; doing so will lead to immediate punishment depending on the severity. All chat rules from [General Rules](https://wiki.discrealms.net/server-information/general-rules#id-5-nsfw-and-inappropriate-content) apply.
