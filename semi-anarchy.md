# Semi-Anarchy

## Gamemode Information

#### History and Background

Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy is based on a classic server once called [Moocraft](https://discord.gg/QwfRhbUDJM), which was shut down on March 7th, 2025. During the announcement of the shutdown of Moocraft, the owner of Disc Realms Studios, Lupancham, who was a member of the Moocraft promotional team, decided to create their own server based on the experiences and nostalgia associated with it.&#x20;

Through the challenges faced by developing Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy, many barriers stood tall, such as buying plugins, spending hours configuring them, and the cost of hosting. Thankfully, at the time of the Beta Season (Season 0), Disc Realms Studios found a server provider that provided the server for free, which was Oracle Cloud. Thanks to Oracle Cloud, we continued development of the server up until September 20th, 2025 (Almost 1 year since the start of development). This was the story of Disc Realms Semi-Anarchy, with so much more to continue as the gamemode continues to grow throughout seasons.
